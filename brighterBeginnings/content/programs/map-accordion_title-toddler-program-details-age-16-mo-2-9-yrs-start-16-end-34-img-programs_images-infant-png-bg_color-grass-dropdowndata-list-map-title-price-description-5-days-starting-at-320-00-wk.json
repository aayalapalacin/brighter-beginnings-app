      "description": "Your toddler builds on the foundations established in our Infant Class, focusing on independence and exploration. After lunch, they take a (1) daily nap on mats where we ask you provide the bedding. Mealtime is structured, with each child having an assigned chair at a table for snacks and lunch. We ask that parents provide all meals- keep in mind we don't have microwaves, we do provide fridge space. Whole milk is available. Your toddler will enjoy sensory activities, including art projects and sensory play with sand, water, and more. They will participate in storytime, sing-alongs, and plenty of outdoor play in our safe play areas, ensuring a stimulating day.",
